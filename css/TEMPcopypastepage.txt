TO FIX:
images on people page overflow collapsible section on 840 (?) screens
DONE one/two/four-section(s) CAN have the margin and padding removed, and should. make sure to go back and remove unnecessary counters to this once you're done.
themed colors are ugly as hell and need to be changed and updated everywhere.
threeD should load as a static image, only opening when prompted.
threeD sizing is incorrect. go back and read/fix it.
story responsiveness could still use some tweaks tbh. specifically with font sizes.
Example translations don't need all that space.
change pre formatted p tags to pre tags!!
change margin and padding em's to rem's
planet page constantly refreshed for some reason
fix colors on planet page (notebook tabs and table every other row) on themes.
change theme names of colorless/bnw
offWhite probably shouldn't change, meaning take it off home header and carousel
honestly the default for text should be justified, then only a couple sections can be centered/lefted


LONG TERM:
            <li>planet specifics (mainly with locations)</li>
            <li>Language interactive images that change when the translator doesn't work</li>

GENREAL:
            <li>put oele'in digital drawings from home onto site</li>
            <li>play with about media query (seems ok for a large majority)</li>
            <li>take everything out of teal notebook</li>
            <li>Food Chain on Planet</li>
            <li>make sure words only glow if accessed from see why/other places like that</li>

            <li>"Fix numbers" it shows a horizontal line to the left of two vertical lines where the ones go. Likely for fives like roman numerals.</li>

            <li>brown   Pemihnoh, Anger   dauq', "X love(7)(4)"", sex   paud, promise   p'nihnuhp, protect   Uhdoohth, run   au/hl/oh, (THE FOUR TYPES OF LOVE: ) romantic   ohsiuhm, familial   pooh/hl/eih, friendshp   esmeih, natural   ohaumau, hour   soohp, jump   seih, milk   deihmau, sac   pauohn*, egg   spen, pregnant   dohdohp, mate   emenih, day   sohuhn (difference between daytime and a day), year   q'au/hl/duh, minute   ohk*ihs, "A"   dihsith, "B"   baun</li>

            <li>nohohohmih mihsedesihm is slang for "keep going" perhaps</li>
            <li>? goes at the beginning of a sentence, like "future"</li>
            <li>change "two" to "de"</li>
            <li>"play around with "who does" and "similar to" being at the beginning of words (goes against big to small clarification)</li>

AND

Make evolution map connecting all the creatures. Include generals like "birds" and "bugs", "more bugs"
Fix anatomy (necks) on old photos and make sure upper uhnuh is the fatless one
Add all the distribution maps and placeholder images
play around with translator
Update all alt="TEMPORARY"'s
Apparently images should weight around 100kb ???? girl... who was gonna tell me...
