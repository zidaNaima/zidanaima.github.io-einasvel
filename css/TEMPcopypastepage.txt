
TO FIX:
images on people page overflow collapsible section on 840 (?) screens
DONE one/two/four-section(s) CAN have the margin and padding removed, and should. make sure to go back and remove unnecessary counters to this once you're done.
story responsiveness could still use some tweaks tbh. specifically with font sizes.
example translations don't need all that space.
honestly the default for text should be justified, then only a couple sections can be centered/lefted
make gaps between sections consistent

EVENTUALLY:
change pre formatted p tags to pre tags!!
change margin and padding em's to rem's
make sure words only glow if accessed from see why/other places like that
"fix numbers". it shows a horizontal line to the left of two vertical lines where the ones go. Likely for fives like roman numerals.
make evolution map connecting all the creatures. Include generals like "birds" and "bugs", "more bugs"
add all the distribution maps and placeholder images
update all alt="TEMPORARY"'s, "FIX"'s, and "TEMP"'s
apparently images should weight around 100kb ???? girl... who was gonna tell me...

FAR OUT LONG TERM:
add planet specifics (mainly with locations)
add realistic translator
add language interactive images that change when the translator doesn't work
put oele'in digital drawings from home onto site
take everything out of teal notebook
food chain on planet
fix anatomy (necks) on old photos and make sure upper uhnuh is the fatless one
