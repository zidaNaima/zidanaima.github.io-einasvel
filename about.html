                            I'm a Computer Science Major in my first year of college, and doing this as a side project.
                            Art is so cool, huh.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I'm a big fan of the human species. People are just so cool, so I decided I'd just make even

                <h3 class="downwards-sub-header">The First Einasvel</h3>
                <p>
                    The original idea came to me slowly. I've always liked the idea of strange blue humanoids
                    with
                    unconventional mannerisms, and I finally found the opportunity to bring them to life as part
                    of an
                    assignment for an art class two years ago.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Inspired by various owl species, vultures, other primate species, prehistoric creatures,
                    1920's to 1930's traditional Rwandan hairstyles, and various black subcultures
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="glow-on-entry">
                    Funny story, because I'm completely terrible at naming things, I was stuck on what to call this
                    species at first. I eventually spotted a thing of Vaseline on my desk and resorted to rearranging
                    the letters until I came up with Einasvel. After later creating the language and sounds, I
                    translated it into the closest thing, Enausq'/hl/, which is why you see those words used
                    interchangeably throughout this site!

            Eleanor and Maukkohd (above) are the humanized versions of the Oele'in E/hl/aunoh and the Enausq'/hl/
            Maukkohd. I wanted to play with how they would be on Earth while keeping as many of their original features
            as possible. With Maukkohd, I kept her height, body type, shape of the hairstyle, large eyes, small
            eyebrows, and large lips. I added strong cheekbones to outline the face similarly to how the fur does, and
            added the facial hair/bangs to do the same. Eleanor is translated much more leniently, as I mainly focused
            on making her an outdoorsy and adventurous character. She spends most of her time outside climbing trees and
            exploring the forest outside their house.
