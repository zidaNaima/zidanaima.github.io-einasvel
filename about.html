                        <p>
                            First off, thank you <i>so</i> much for visiting my website! This project means a lot to me
                            and I hope that by sharing it with other people I can inspire a little more passion in the
                            world. I update this site regularly, so feel free to come back later and see if you can find
                            anything new!
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I'm a Computer Science Major in my first year of college, but art has been my passion for as
                            long as I can remember, so to keep me sane I've been doing this as a side project!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I'm minoring in Anthropology to learn more about the diverse cultures, languages, and people
                            of the world that fascinate me so much. I'm a big fan of the human species. People are just
                            so cool, so I decided I'd just make even
                            <i>more</i> people.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>And as a closing note, if you ever want to reach out to talk about practically anything, I
                            would love to get to know you.</p>

                <h3 class="downwards-sub-header">The First Einasvel</h3>
                <p>
                    The original idea came to me slowly. I've always liked the idea of strange blue humanoids
                    with
                    unconventional mannerisms, and I finally found the opportunity to bring them to life as part
                    of an
                    assignment for an art class two years ago.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Inspired by various owl species, vultures, other primate species, prehistoric creatures,
                    1920's to 1930's traditional Rwandan hairstyles, and various black subcultures.
                </p>

                <p class="glow-on-entry">
                    Funny story, because I'm completely terrible at naming things, I was stuck on what to call this
                    species at first. I eventually spotted a thing of Vaseline on my desk and resorted to rearranging
                    the letters until I came up with Einasvel. After later creating the language and sounds, I
                    translated it into the closest thing, Enausq'/hl/, which is why you see those words used
                    interchangeably throughout this site!

            Eleanor and Maukkohd (above) are the humanized versions of the Oele'in E/hl/aunoh and the Enausq'/hl/
            Maukkohd. I wanted to play with how they would be on Earth while keeping as many of their original features
            as possible. With Maukkohd, I kept her height, body type, shape of the hairstyle, large eyes, small
            eyebrows, and large lips. I added strong cheekbones to outline the face similarly to how the fur does, and
            added the facial hair/bangs to do the same. Eleanor is translated much more leniently, as I mainly focused
            on making her an outdoorsy and adventurous character. She spends most of her time outside climbing trees and
            exploring the forest outside their house.
