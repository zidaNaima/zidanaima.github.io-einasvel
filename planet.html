                        Ok&deg;s/hl/id are used by Enausq'/hl/ to send messages to far off villages. They draw them
                        to dry areas using their hands to splash into buckets of water, imitating the sound of the sea.
                        They hold fish out for them, and
                        when they're close enough, slap various paint colors on parts of their body as code for
                        different things.

                        They typically travel in groups of 1000-4000 and move as a sort of hivemind. It is highly
                        advised to not attack an Ok&deg;s/hl/ihd. They are blind and weak, but in their large numbers

                        Water-Eaters are known for their style of feeding, which is to filter through water for bacteria
                        and microorganisms using the same fibrous mouth as a Baleen
                        whale.

                    <ul>
                        <li>They use their two front appendages to scrape algae from rocks and stir up still water to
                            feed
                            more effectively. The two tusks work to effectively push away larger objects in the water.
                        </li>
                        <li>They have brightly colored back ends filled with poison in order to deter predators
                            attacking
                            while they feed.</li>

                    <p>Built like a bison and as common as deer, many folklore tales revolve around Ooheihaudeih due to
                        their uncomfortably dexterous hands and uncanny resemblance to an Enausq'/hl/ face. In the dark,
                        it is an unwelcome
                        sight.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Killing them is slightly looked down on due to the resemblance, but their fur is the best
                            source of hair extentions.</li>
                        <li>They are herded by some, but because they are still dangerous, it is not extremely common.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you do kill one, their horns make wonderful weapons in combat, although horned combat is
                            difficult to learn, and doing the needed alterations to the horns is not a common skill.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The front of their faces are covered in a hard plate, where their noses lies attached at the
                            bottom. They can drink water through their nose, but can't move this plate, so they have a
                            long tongue to pick up food.</li>
                        <li>They have four eyes, two to the sides and two at the front</li>

                        by Einasvel and hung on the branches of their homes to be used to find the way at night.

                        The color is based on the nutrient levels and content of where it grew, and ranges wildly. Some
                        examples are (from most to least common):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="heavy">Dusty blue</span> grows in dry locations with lots of direct sunlight.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="heavy">Lilac</span> in locations with more indirect than direct light. It grows
                            the longest out of any other variation at around two feet.</li>
                        <li><span class="heavy">Green</span></li>
                        <li><span class="heavy">Yellow</span></li>
                        <li><span class="heavy">Pale red-orange</span></li>
                        <li><span class="heavy">Dark green. Glows the dimmest. Commonly used to create
                                hairstyles.</span> in places with low direct light and heavy water.</li>
                        <li><span class="heavy">Deep red</span> grows in wetter areas with low indirect light, such as
                            the sides of large rock formations and caves. It's a common meal for creatures in the area
                            who don't have much else to eat, so it grows short and dark to blend into the environment.
                            It is hard to remove and is much softer than other variants.</li>
                        <!-- more water, less water, more direct light, less direct light, more indirect light, less indirect light, in places it's eaten more frequently would it be more likely to blend into the walls of the environment, and it would grow shorter too. Sounds like a deep red thing. -->
