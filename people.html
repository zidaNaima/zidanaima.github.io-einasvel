                        They turn with the head, but not nearly as significantly due to their position at the bas of

                            Sexual Dimorphism is how sexes differ from each other, including size, color, behavior,
                            and
                            reproductive organs. Many birds have no sexual dimorphism looks wise. The more
                            monogamous a
                            species is, generally the less dimorphic they are. One male mating with multiple females
                            will
                            look different so they can find each other faster.

                            Fertilization can be internal (humans) or external (typically in aquatic environments).
                            External fertilization is done when a male deposits sperm into the environment and a
                            female
                            picks it
                            up. After, eggs can be laid (oviparity) (can be soft and leathery like non-avian
                            reptiles)
                            or kept inside (ovoviparity), where they "hatch" inside or are laid
                            right
                            before hatch (platyfish, some sharks, lizards, etc.). Viviparity is when the young are
                            born
                            alive and obtain nutrients from the mother as opposed to the yolk.

                        at your chest, fingers pointing towards yourself. Pointing is done with the wrists to

                    <p>
                        Natural Hair only grows around 1-1.5 inches long around the body, save for the shoulders
                        and
                        upper chest where it can grow up to 5 inches.
                        <br> <br>
                        Hairstyles can vary widely, but typically sticks to short and medium length "spikes"
                        along
                        the
                        head, neck, and legs.
                        <br> <br>
                        Hair for hairstyles is gotten by either taking shaved fur from other Einasvel and
                        animals or
                        through a special process of drying, bleaching, and dying specific types of glow moss.
                        However
                        it is gotten, the hair is stuck to the head using a sticky sap solution made with ___
                        plants
                        and
                        ___.
                        <br> <br>
                        Because hair grows slowly and lightly on Einasvel, having large and complex hairstyles
                        made
                        from
                        others' fur is a status symbol of being highly loved.It is not uncommon for hairstyles
                        to be
                        removed (intact) from one Einasvel and planted onto the head of their child or loved
                        one.
                        Having
                        big hair is also a sign of being the main caretaker of your child, because it means
                        their
                        partner has no use for the long hair on their shoulders.

                        such

                        - Long Unuhnih/hl/uh so they appear larger and more intimidating. Larger fat sacks

                        are capable of hunting enough food to sustain themselves.
                        <br>
                        - Fast and loud beak clicking to ward of attackers.
                        <br>
                        - Head bobbing with smooth/wide movements show you can keep an eye out for predators
                        and
                        prey,
                        given that their eyes cannot move within heir skull
                        <br>
                        - Hair in the forearms starting higher up the arm, which shows (similarly to a

                        Vulture)

                        <br> <br>
                        Aside from protective attributes, some other things Einasvel find attractive are
                        symmetry
                        (in
                        hair, clothing, and ear holes) and large, color matched hair.
                        <br> <br>
                        The process of courting involves a dance, where Enausq/hl/ 'A' will approach

                        'B'

                        It
                        is done as a way of saying "I want to be with you, so you will eventually be seeing

                        "k&deg;k&deg;" is used to talk down to someone, in a similar way we would say "hey

                        If an Einasvel harm or kill another in a way the rest of the group/village deem
                        unjustified,
                        they will
                        throw a ceremony of shame. They will dance and yell around the guilty person, and
                        force
                        them
                        to
                        bite off all
                        of their fingers (excluding the thumb) at the second joint (the DIP joint). The
                        guilty
                        will
                        be
                        given supplies, but must treat their own wounds. Once the fingers fully heal, they
                        will
                        be
                        treated normally by the rest of the group.
                        <br> <br>
                        During the ceremony itself, the group will stand around the guilty in a long and
                        narrow
                        oval
                        shoulder to shoulder. They walk sideways in a loop, hissing and throwing up their
                        unuhnih/hl/uh
                        to make themselves bigger, trying to intimidate the guilty into biting themselves.
                        Young
                        Einasvel who are too little to intimidate the guilty will split into two teams and
                        run
                        along
                        the
                        outside of the group, parallel to the guilty, and hold up sticks. The children and
                        sticks
                        act as
                        "point markers" based on the distance from the victim they are. When the guilty
                        finally
                        bites
                        off their fingers, the Einasvel who was within the highest point barrier is marked
                        as
                        the
                        "most
                        intimidating" that finally drove them over the edge.
                        <br> <br>
                        These "winners" are marked by the children with _(white paint along their arms and
                        hands)_
                        and
                        rewarded during the following days by the rest of the village, receiving _(first
                        bites
                        at
                        the

                        When an Einasvel die, their body is taken far outside of the living territory and
                        left
                        to be
                        eaten by other creatures. Their hair is left on so that they are able to "die
                        loved."
                        <br> <br>
                        Doing this creates a buffer where predators are then less likely to hunt living
                        Einasvel.
                        To
                        make sure predators don't associate them for an easy meal, they wrap the dead in
                        thick
                        leaves that still take effort to dig through.
