                            Sexual Dimorphism is how sexes differ from each other, including size, color, behavior,

                            reproductive organs. Many birds have no sexual dimorphism looks wise. The more

                            species is, generally the less dimorphic they are. One male mating with multiple females
                            will
                            look different so they can find each other faster.

                            Fertilization can be internal (humans) or external (typically in aquatic environments).
                            External fertilization is done when a male deposits sperm into the environment and a female
                            picks it
                            up. After, eggs can be laid (oviparity) (can be soft and leathery like non-avian reptiles)
                            or kept inside (ovoviparity), where they "hatch" inside or are laid
                            right
                            before hatch (platyfish, some sharks, lizards, etc.). Viviparity is when the young are
                            born
                            alive and obtain nutrients from the mother as opposed to the yolk.

                            Natural Hair only grows around 1-1.5 inches long around the body, save for the shoulders
                            and
                            upper chest where it can grow up to 5 inches.

                        <p>
                            Hairstyles can vary widely, but typically sticks to short and medium length "spikes"

                            the

                        <p>
                            Hair for hairstyles is gotten by either taking shaved fur from other Einasvel and
                            animals or
                            through a special process of drying, bleaching, and dying specific types of glow moss.
                            However
                            it is gotten, the hair is stuck to the head using a sticky sap solution made with ___
                            plants
                            and
                            ___.

                            made
                            from
                            others' fur is a status symbol of being highly loved.It is not uncommon for hairstyles
                            to be
                            removed (intact) from one Einasvel and planted onto the head of their child or loved
                            one.
                            Having
                            big hair is also a sign of being the main caretaker of your child, because it means
                            their

                            The Enausq'/hl/ society relies on bartering and equivalent exchange, measured in the
                            personal preferences of the Enausq'/hl/'s in the trade. For example, one Enausq'/hl/ may
                            want a bundle of Lilac Glow Moss in exchange for two fist sized stump creatures, while
                            another may have no interest in Glow Moss and request shelter for a night instead.

                            If an Einasvel harm or kill another in a way the rest of the group/village deem
                            unjustified,
                            they will
                            throw a ceremony of shame. They will dance and yell around the guilty person, and force
                            them
                            to
                            bite off all
                            of their fingers (excluding the thumb) at the second joint (the DIP joint). The guilty
                            will
                            be
                            given supplies, but must treat their own wounds. Once the fingers fully heal, they will
                            be
                            treated normally by the rest of the group.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the ceremony itself, the group will stand around the guilty in a long and narrow
                            oval
                            shoulder to shoulder. They walk sideways in a loop, hissing and throwing up their
                            unuhnih/hl/uh
                            to make themselves bigger, trying to intimidate the guilty into biting themselves. Young
                            Einasvel who are too little to intimidate the guilty will split into two teams and run
                            along
                            the
                            outside of the group, parallel to the guilty, and hold up sticks. The children and
                            sticks
                            act as
                            "point markers" based on the distance from the victim they are. When the guilty finally
                            bites
                            off their fingers, the Einasvel who was within the highest point barrier is marked as
                            the
                            "most
                            intimidating" that finally drove them over the edge.
