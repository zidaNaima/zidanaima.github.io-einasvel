                            Sexual dimorphism is how sexes differ from each other, including size, color, behavior,
                            and
                            reproductive organs. Many birds have no sexual dimorphism looks wise. The more
                            monogamous a
                            species is, generally the less dimorphic they are. One male mating with multiple females
                            will
                            look different so they can find each other faster.

                            Fertilization can be internal (humans) or external (typically in aquatic environments).
                            External fertilization is done when a male deposits sperm into the environment and a
                            female
                            picks it
                            up. After, eggs can be laid (oviparity) (can be soft and leathery like non-avian
                            reptiles)
                            or kept inside (ovoviparity), where they "hatch" inside or are laid
                            right
                            before hatch (platyfish, some sharks, lizards, etc.). Viviparity is when the young are
                            born
                            alive and obtain nutrients from the mother as opposed to the yolk.

                        Natural Hair only grows around 1-1.5 inches long around the body, save for the shoulders
                        and
                        upper chest where it can grow up to 5 inches.
                        <br> <br>
                        Hairstyles can vary widely, but typically sticks to short and medium length "spikes"
                        along
                        the
                        head, neck, and legs.
                        <br> <br>
                        Hair for hairstyles is gotten by either taking shaved fur from other Einasvel and
                        animals or
                        through a special process of drying, bleaching, and dying specific types of glow moss.
                        However
                        it is gotten, the hair is stuck to the head using a sticky sap solution made with ___
                        plants
                        and
                        ___.
                        <br> <br>
                        Because hair grows slowly and lightly on einasvel, having large and complex hairstyles
                        made
                        from
                        others' fur is a status symbol of being highly loved.It is not uncommon for hairstyles
                        to be
                        removed (intact) from one einasvel and planted onto the head of their child or loved
                        one.
                        Having
                        big hair is also a sign of being the main caretaker of your child, because it means
                        their
                        partner has no use for the long hair on their shoulders.

                        are capable of hunting enough food to sustain themselves.

                        <br>
                        - Head bobbing with smooth/wide movements show you can keep an eye out for predators
                        and
                        prey,

                        <br>
                        - Hair in the forearms starting higher up the arm, which shows (similarly to a

                        Aside from protective attributes, some other things Einasvel find attractive are

                        (in

                        The process of courting involves a dance, where enausq/hl/ 'A' will approach
                        enausq/hl/
                        'B'
                        and perform a series of facial expressions that range across all emotions and
                        feelings.
                        It
                        is done as a way of saying "I want to be with you, so you will eventually be seeing
                        all
                        of
                        these expressions from me." A wider range of looks is valued more, and the accuracy
                        and
                        effort put into expressions is considered by B as well, as it shows honestly and
                        self
                        awareness. If B finds the expressions attractive, they will reciprocate by showing
                        their
                        own
                        expressions back.

                <b>The Age of Technology:</b> Enausq'/hl/ are one of few advanced species on the planet. They
                are still in the stone age, with writing systems just recently starting to form. Due to their slow
                advancements and disinterest, within the short lifetime of the planet, they are unlikely to make it
                to
                the
                iron age and beyond.

                technologically

                        share.
                        Enausq'/hl/ are more prone to share information orally. In the past, outcasts wrote
                        stories
                        and
                        poems with their beaks, carving onto thin strips of soft wood, but because their
                        beaks
                        would
                        dull over time, they switched to jagged stones and sticks.

                        throw a ceremony of shame. They will dance and yell around the guilty person, and

                        them
                        to
                        bite off all
                        of their fingers (excluding the thumb) at the second joint (the DIP joint). The
                        guilty

                        be
                        given supplies, but must treat their own wounds. Once the fingers fully heal, they
                        will
                        be
                        treated normally by the rest of the group.
                        <br> <br>
                        During the ceremony itself, the group will stand around the guilty in a long and

                        uhnuhnih/hl/uh
                        to make themselves bigger, trying to intimidate the guilty into biting themselves.
                        Young
                        einasvel who are too little to intimidate the guilty will split into two teams and
                        run
                        along
                        the
                        outside of the group, parallel to the guilty, and hold up sticks. The children and
                        sticks
                        act as
                        "point markers" based on the distance from the victim they are. When the guilty
                        finally
                        bites
                        off their fingers, the einasvel who was within the highest point barrier is marked

                        <br> <br>
                        Doing this creates a buffer where predators are then less likely to hunt living
                        einasvel.
                        To
                        make sure predators don't associate them for an easy meal, they wrap the dead in
                        thick
                        leaves that still take effort to dig through.
